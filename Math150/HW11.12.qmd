# Problem 1
```{r}
my_vector <- c(24, 17, 26, 33, 21, 38, 24, 13, 41, 17, 
               15, 19, 12, 29, 19, 24, 31, 15)

sample_mean <- mean(my_vector)
sample_sd <- sd(my_vector)

conf_level <- qt(0.995, 17)

conf_level*(sample_mean/sqrt(18))

mu <- conf_level*(sample_mean/sqrt(18))

sample_mean - mu
sample_mean + mu


```

# Problem 2
```{r}
mean_hp <- mean(mtcars$hp)
sd_hp <- 1.2

Conflvl_hp <- qt(0.975, 31)

Conflvl_hp * (sd_hp/sqrt(32))
mu = Conflvl_hp * (sd_hp/sqrt(32))

mean_hp
mean_hp - mu
mean_hp + mu

```

# Problem 3
In a random sample of 32 chocolate bars, the mean calorie count is 204.0 and the standard deviation is 12.8.
Compute a level 95% confidence interval for the population mean.
```{r}
conf_level <- qt(0.975, 31)

mean_chocbar <- 204
sd_chocbar <- 12.8

conf_level * (sd_chocbar/sqrt(32))
mu = conf_level * (sd_chocbar/sqrt(32))

mean_chocbar
mean_chocbar + mu
mean_chocbar - mu

```
