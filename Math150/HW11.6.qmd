# Problem 1
Compute P(T <−1.1) in t(22).

```{r}
pt(-1.1, 22)
```

# Problem 2
Compute P(−1.5 <T <.4) in t(5).
```{r}
pt(0.4, 5) - pt(-1.5, 5)
```

# Problem 3
Find the number τ such that P(T > $\tau$) =.05 in t(80). Note that this a right-tailed probability, not a left-tailed
one.
```{r}
qt(1-0.05, 80)
```
\newpage

# Problem 4
Find the number τ such that 95% of the area under t(6) lies between −$\tau$ and $\tau$.
```{r}
qt((1-0.95)/2, 6)
qt(0.025, 6)
qt(0.975, 6)
```
