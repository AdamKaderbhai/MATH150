# Problem 1

A probability experiment consists of flipping a coin and then rolling a standard 6-sided die.

## (a) Identify the sample space

There are two sample spaces here 
- C -> All the possible outcomes for flipping a coin
- D -> All the possible outcomes for rolling a die

- C = {H,T}
- D = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

- |C| = 2
- |D| = 6

## (b) Write the event, “the coin is a tail and the die roll isn’t a 5” as a set.
- E_1 = {T}
- E_2 = {1,2,3,4,6}

## (c) What is the probability of the event in part (b)? Assume all outcomes are equally likely.
- p(E_1) = 1/2
- p(E_2) = 5/6

## d) What is the probability that the coin is a head and the die roll is odd?

- p = 1/2
- p = 3/6
