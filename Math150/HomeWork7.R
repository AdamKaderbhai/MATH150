# 3.) 
#Median : The median is the value that splits a data set exactly in half when the set is ordered from smallest to largest. 
150/2 
# When all frequencies to added to get the target = 75
6 + 20 + 13 + 19 + 23
# Our goal is to get a value as close as 75. When I add up all the frequencies the closest value I am getting is 81.
# We can estimate that the median falls under the range 1.25 - 2.5 mins

# Mean: The mean is the sum of the values in a set divided by the number of values. Itâ€™s the simple numerical average.
# For this question I estimate the Mean to be in the range 2.5 - 3.75mins.
# Given the Range of the median, the mean is shifted slightly towards the right because of the skewed values on right
