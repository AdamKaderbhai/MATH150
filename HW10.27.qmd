# Problem 1

## a.)

```{r}
heights <- c(160, 165, 170, 185)

mean(heights)
sd(heights)
```

## b.)

```{r}
mean(c(160, 160))
mean(c(160, 165))
mean(c(160, 170))
mean(c(160, 185))
mean(c(165, 165))
mean(c(165, 170))
mean(c(165, 185))
mean(c(170, 170))
mean(c(170, 185))
mean(c(185, 185))
```
\newpage

## c.)
```{r}
sample_means <- c(160, 162.5, 165, 172.5, 165, 167.5, 175, 170, 177.5, 185)

mean(sample_means)
sd(sample_means)
```

## d.)
```{r}
sd(heights) / sqrt(2)
```

# Problem 2
```{r}
mu <- 90 # sample mean same as population mean 
sigma <- 12
n <- 25

mu
sigma / sqrt(n)

```

# Problem 3
```{r}
mu <- 90 # sample mean same as population mean 
sigma <- 12
n <- 100

mu
sigma / sqrt(n)
```
